    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py containing the script to create and train the model\n",
    "* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode\n",

    "### Data collection and balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. I have tried various data set: \n",
    "1. Self-collected data from simulator \n",
    "2. Default data from Udacity\n",
    "3. Recovery data from road edge to road center turn.\n",
    "4. Zigzag running data\n",
    "\n",
    "However, among all these data, only Default data from Udacity worked well. I think it is the reason that the data was collected in joystick. By keyborads it is very diffculty to collect high quality data with continuous steering angle changing data. This experience has taught me that a good quality data makes difference in the deep learning model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Label distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to analyze is to check the label distribution. In the deep learning model the steering angles are the label that need to be learnt from the data. After drawing the histogram of steering angles distributions below, we can see that there zero angle consist most of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The histogram of the original data\n",

    "* The samples from the original data\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image8]  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Data balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "We balance the data by randomly picking up 15% of the those data that the angles are zero. In the experiment, we see that with too many portion of zero angle steering data, the car are more likely to run stright. And the balanced data plays an important role in predicting the steering angle in the later on model training. The following function does the balancing:\n",

    "        if float(line[3]) != 0:\n",
    "            image_process(line,data_path)       \n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            prob = np.random.uniform()\n",
    "            if prob <= 0.15: #adjust the ratio to balance the data\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In this project, I have done several image processing, such as \n",
    "2. Image crop: to get rid of redundant information like trees, sky and front of car body\n",
    "3. Image resize: to fit into the deep learning model designed by Nvidia\n",
    "4. Image flip: To balance the turning right data\n",
    "5. Image color channel change: to standout the lane in the image.\n",

    "After fine-tuning the s channel to make the road lane standout in the image, we pad processed s channel with two other channels with zeros to make sure the image is 64x64x3, it looks like the following:\n",

    "### Deep model construction\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested NVIDIA  architecture but I did not do the normalization part for the data but it went well. I used keras API to build the model, compared to tensorflow we used in the previous section, keras API is much more easy to handle and easy to check the input-output parameters\n",

    "As we can see from the video that the car was swinging in the road even though the car did not run out of the track. This is due to the right and left images data with correction on the steering angle that were used in the training. And I have tuned the correction value for many rounds and 0.15 was the value that makes the car run inside the lane but still now stable enough.  I have also spent more than two weeks to train the model and process the image under various method, like change the brightness change the size, but those only helps were presented above in this note. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among all the 4 projects that I have done, this one is most challenging for me because I have failed many times in the big turn corner place where the car were always not able to turn big enough to stay inside the lane. But after many trials and errors, I am able to ensure the car runing insde the lane. Even though I am not very satisfied with the performance now but I have no other solutions for the moment now I will first submit first to wait for better suggested solutions. \n",

    "In the modified version, I processed the image in HLS channel, which I learnt during the project for advanced lane detection.\n",
